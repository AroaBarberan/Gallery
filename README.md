# Gallery
Image gallery without any template engine.

You can see it here; http://vanaros.esy.es/Gallery/gallery.html

The main page loads all the images that are in the database.

The close window button will close as many windows as you have opened.

Passing the mouse for each image appears a text box with the title and description of the image.

If you click on an image, it will open in a new window showing that image, title, description, author, category to which it belongs, type of image, coordinates and url.

All images are related to an author and a category.
If you are an administrator you can delete images (so when reloading the page they would no longer appear), create categories, authors, upload images and choose their category and author.

In case of deleting a category or author, their images would become a category or author by default since they always have to have a related author or category.
